<h3 class="no-break"><b>THE PETIT TRIANON: VERSAILLES.</b></h3>






<p class="p2">During the first years of his reign,
Louis the XIV. of France resided,
as his predecessors had, at St. Germain
in summer; but for some reason&mdash;it
is alleged that it was because the windows
of the palace commanded a view of St.
Denis, the royal mausoleum&mdash;he conceived
a dislike to it, and resolved to build another
summer palace for himself at some spot
not far from Paris. Why he chose Versailles
is incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the motive,
however, he decided to erect upon this
desolate, waterless and uninhabited site a
vast palace to be surrounded by a park.</p>

<p>The cost of accomplishing this project
was fearful, not in money alone (although
this was more than one thousand million
francs), but in human life. In 1681 twenty-two
thousand soldiers and six thousand
horses were employed on the work, and so
unhealthy was the site that the workmen
died by thousands. Writing in 1767,
Madame de Sévigné says: "The King is in
haste that Versailles should be finished;
but it would seem that God is unwilling.
It is almost impossible to continue the
work owing to the fearful mortality among
the workmen. The corpses are fetched
away by cartfuls during the night,&mdash;night
being chosen that they who still live may
not be terrified into revolt by the sight."
But no difficulty, nor the pestilence, nor
the ruin of the treasury was allowed to
interfere with the King's pleasure. The
palace rose; the stately gardens, peopled
with statues, spread about it; and a royal
city sprang up where before had been only
a desolate forest; and, after 1682, Versailles
became the permanent headquarters of the
Court.</p>

<p>In the immense park, some three-quarters
of a mile northwest from the
terraces of the palace, Louis XIV. built a
little palace to gratify Madame de Maintenon,
which, from the fact that it stood
on the site of the parish of Trianon, which
was demolished to make a site for it, and
because its façade was ornamented with
porcelain plaques of blue and white faience
ware, was called the "Trianon de Porcelaine";
but in 1687 Louis, who had as Saint-Simon
said, "a rage for building," demolished
this frail structure and replaced it
with another, designed by Mansart, which
we now know as the "Grand Trianon."
This building was the King's delight for a
few years, but after 1700 he wearied of the
plaything, and turned all his attention to
his new château at Marly.</p>

<p>During the Regency the Trianon was
almost abandoned; but when, under Louis
XV., the Court returned to Versailles, the
building became a favorite refuge for the
King; and he later gave it to his mistress,
Madame de Pompadour, for her own. She,
being at her wits' end to devise some new
scheme to distract the daily increasing
melancholy of the King, hit upon the expedient
of establishing in the grounds which
were attached to the Grand Trianon, a real
practical dairy and farm; and for that purpose
imported from Holland a herd of fine
cows, and collected a number of rare varieties
of hens and pigeons, which Louis
amused himself for some time in breeding.
But in 1754 the royal caprice again changed,
and Louis abolished the farm, and made the
land into a botanical garden. Here he established
conservatories for raising fruits
out of their natural seasons, and collected
a great number of exotic trees and shrubs
of every variety and species. Taking great
delight in this garden, which was some
distance from the Grand Trianon, he conceived
the notion of building in the midst
of it a still smaller château, modelled upon
the Grand Trianon as that itself had been
a miniature of Versailles. This château,
the Little Trianon, was erected in 1766 by
the royal architect, Gabriel, and was given
by the King to the mistress who had succeeded
Madame du Pompadour in his favor,
Madame Du Barry. It was while staying at
the Petit Trianon that Louis was attacked
by the small-pox, of which he died.</p>

<p>The château of the Petit Trianon is an
interesting building, architecturally, marking,
as it does, the transition stage between
the styles of Louis XV. and Louis
XVI.&mdash;a return to purer classical traditions.
The façade is ornamented by a portico
with four detached Corinthian columns,
and the whole is surmounted by a balustrade.
The reception and billiard rooms
occupied the first floor, while the second
was occupied by the private apartments.</p>

<p>While Marie Antoinette was still the
Dauphine, she had often expressed a desire
to have a château, apart from the palace,
for her own, where, free from the intolerable
restraints of Court etiquette, she might
amuse herself as she chose; and shortly
after his accession to the throne, Louis
XVI. is said to have presented her with the
Trianons with the words, "They have
always belonged to the King's favorites,
and should therefore now be yours." The
Queen answered laughingly that she would
gladly accept the Little Trianon, but only
upon the condition that it should be unreservedly
her own, and that even the King
should come there only upon her express
invitation.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette's first wish, after becoming
mistress of her new domain, was to
establish there a garden after the English
style. The rage for the English garden
had just then seized French society, for it
was believed to be a return to Nature&mdash;Nature
which Rousseau just then had made
it the fashion to adore, and the nobility
were all for playing at rusticity, and full of
sentimental admiration for the country.</p>

<p>The King humored the whim, and gave
orders that the gardens already existing at
the Trianon should be remodelled, that the
strip of land joining it should be added,
and the whole surrounded with a wall, and
the work pushed as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>The plans for the English garden were
drawn by Comte de Caraman, an officer
who had already arranged such a garden in
connection with his own residence, and this
garden the Queen had visited. In 1775 the
new royal architect, Mique, seconded by
the painter, Hubert Robert, the sculptor,
Deschamps, and the landscape gardener,
Antoine Richard, joined in working out
the plans of the Comte de Caraman, and
created an English garden after the Queen's
fancy. Unhappily, however, in order to
create this new garden it became necessary
to destroy a large part of the
botanical garden which had before
existed; but many of the
fine exotic trees were employed
in working out the new design,
and these trees still remain the
finest ornaments of the park.</p>

<p>The plan for the English
garden was comprised as follows:
In the more formal portions
of the grounds near the
château an artificial grotto and
a "Belvedere," and, shadowed
by overhanging trees, a little
"Temple de l'Amour." Separated
from these classical constructions
by an artificial lake,
bordered with rustic paths and
intended to represent a bit of
natural country, was erected a
picturesque miniature hamlet
of nine or ten rustic cottages
in which the court ladies, under
the lead of the Queen, might
play at peasant life.</p>

<p>The grotto was a work of
some elaboration, and it was
said that no less than seven relief
models of it were made
before the Queen expressed
herself as satisfied with the
design. It is an arrangement
of artificial rocks covered
with moss, through which
flows the outlet stream of the little
lake. It was at one time proposed, after
the then fashion in English gardening, to
build on the top of the grotto a picturesquely
contrived ruin, but this project
was abandoned.</p>

<p>Near the grotto stands the Belvedere&mdash;a
coquettish little octagonal pavilion set on
a stone platform. Four windows and four
doors are set alternately in its eight surfaces,
and a balustrade surrounds the domed
roof. The interior was ornamented in
delicately frescoed stucco.</p>

<p>The Temple of Love consists of twelve
Corinthian columns supporting a cupola.
The pavement is of white blue-veined
marble. In the centre is a carved pedestal
on which stands a statue of Cupid drawing
his bow, modelled by Bouchardon.</p>

<p>The most picturesque feature of the garden
was, however, the village or hamlet,
and it is here the life of the Trianon centered
in the time of the Queen.</p>

<p>The houses with which the hamlet was
comprised were situated on the farther
shore of a small artificial lake; and were
divided into two groups separated by a
running stream. The first group was made
up of the "Queen's House" and its connected
"Billiard Hall," and the "Mill":
the second originally comprised five buildings;&mdash;a
"Gardener's Lodge," a "Poultry
House," a tower, called "Marlborough's
Tower" with a "Dairy" attached
to it, and, at some distance
from these, a "Farm
House" with its dependencies.</p>

<p>We have preferred in the
description to adhere to the
names by which these buildings
were originally called
rather than to adopt the more
fanciful nomenclature given
to them later by an imaginative
German, Dr. Meyer, who
visited France in 1796 and who
invented the story that the
Queen, playing at rural life,
had entrusted the King with
the rôle of the farmer, while
she became the farmer's wife
and the Count d'Artois the
huntsman, the Comte de Provence
the miller, and the Cardinal
de Rohan the curé of this
tiny community. In accordance
with this unfounded tale
the Queen's house has been
nicknamed the "Maison du
Seigneur," the poultry house
the "Presbytère" and so forth,&mdash;and
these nicknames have
clung to them ever since.</p>

<p>The simplicity of the buildings
of the hamlet makes it
unnecessary to describe them
in detail. They were erected
during the years 1783, 1784
and 1785 from designs by the
architect Mique. The exteriors
were covered with stucco to represent old
brick, weather-worn stone and worm-eaten
wood, and all of them, with the exception
of the "Queen's House" which was partly
covered with tiles, were roofed with thatch.</p>

<p>The "Queen's House" and "Billiard
Hall" were connected by a rustic gallery,
painted olive-green. The former contained
a dining-room and some private apartments.
The "Billiard Hall," as its name
implies, was mainly occupied by a billiard
room over which were sleeping chambers.</p>

<p>The "Mill" was at one time furnished
with a mill-wheel and actually and practically
used to grind grain for the inhabitants
of the tiny village. The "Gardener's
House" has been demolished. The "Poultry-House"
was at one time used for the
care of fowls and pigeons of which the
Queen had a large number.</p>

<p>As we have said, an almost indispensable
feature of the English garden of this time
was an artificial ruin; but although many
models were made for the erection of such
a ruin at the Petit-Trianon, none was ever
erected. As a substitute however, a round
tower was built, and in honor of the original
the "Chanson de Marlborough," with
its simple and plaintive air, which had just
then been revived in popular favor, was
named "Marlborough's Tower." It is
probable that the building was supposed to
suggest that tower from which Marlborough's
widow saw the page "<i>tout de noir
habillé</i>" who came to tell her of her husband's
death. The tower ascended by an
exterior staircase, and at the top was a circular
balcony from which a view of the
whole domain was visible, and from which
signals might be exchanged with the palace
at Versailles.</p>

<p>The tower was connected by a passage
with the "Dairy,"&mdash;an actual and practical
creamery on a small scale, in which the
Queen and her ladies played at making butter
and cheese. The walls and floor were
tiled with marble, and the tables on which
the pans and utensils&mdash;all of decorated
porcelain&mdash;were set out were also of marble.
A running stream of water was conducted
through the dairy to keep it cool.</p>

<p>The "Farm" buildings comprised a
group of constructions, in which the farmer
lodged, and in which were stables for cows
of which the Queen had a
splendid Swiss herd.</p>

<p>The completed gardens of
the Little Trianon excited the
most lively praise. The poet,
Chevalier Bertin, dedicated a
whole elegy to them; the
Prince de Ligne wrote, "Here
truly one may breathe air of
happiness and liberty. One
might believe one's self a hundred
leagues from the Court."
The village presented a real
aspect of a rural hamlet. Indeed
the Queen had under her
eyes a living picture of the
country, whence she could see
the cows grazing, peasants
laboring in the fields, the cultivation
of gardens, the pruning
of trees, the cows coming to
drink at the lake, the washwomen
washing their clothes
at the stream which flowed
from the mill, and the little
mill itself, grinding grain for
the inhabitants of this miniature
village.</p>

<p>It was at this Trianon that
Marie Antoinette spent her
happiest days. "The Queen,"
writes Madam Campan, "spent
sometimes an entire month together
at the Little Trianon, where she had
established her pianoforte and tapestry
frames." There were but few apartments
in the château of the Little Trianon and
although Madame Elizabeth usually accompanied
the Queen here, the ladies of honor
could not be accommodated, and unless by
special invitation from the Queen it was the
rule to come from Versailles only at the dinner
hour. The King and the Princess came
regularly to sup. A white muslin and a
straw hat was the accustomed dress of the
princesses, and the pleasure of running
about the little village to see the cows
milked and to fish in the lake, enchanted
the Queen, and with every successive year
she showed less inclination for the stiff etiquette
of the Court.</p>

<p>Here on the 5th of October, the news was
brought her of the arrival at the Court of
the crowd of women from Paris, and she
was forced to go immediately to Versailles
to meet them, never again to see her little
domain.</p>

<p class="p2">In adopting the Renaissance style as a
motive in interior decoration, England
lagged behind the Continental
nations. Such English mansions and
furniture as remained after the Wars of the
Roses were all of the Gothic type; and with
no other models available, it was but natural
that the first efforts of English workmen,
after art began to revive, should be
Gothic in feeling. Moreover, for a long
time most of the carved wood-work and
furniture in the new style with which England
was supplied, was imported from Holland,
and it is in some measure to Dutch
example that the heavy character of the
Elizabethan style in furniture and carving
must be attributed.</p>

<p>The style was, therefore, neither Classic
nor Gothic, but a mixture of the two, tinged
with Dutch and Flemish influence; and
yet, mongrel as it was, it had an individuality
of its own&mdash;a certain, royal, dignified
and stately charm.</p>

<p>The first distinguishing feature of Elizabethan
ornamental carving is
"strap-work," a term which
exactly describes this elaborate
tracery,&mdash;an imitation
of straps and buckles,
varied sufficiently to atone for
the meagreness of the type,
and relying for its decorative
value upon its repetition and
symmetry. There are many
rooms in old English houses
where this strap-decoration is
carried out with so delicate and
fanciful a use of the interlacing
line as to be nearly as satisfying
as the Saracenic work of
the same type; but it is, after
all, nothing but a play of line,
and, while allowing the greatest
scope to the individuality
of the artist, requires genius
to properly develop it. Too
frequently it is but the merest
medley of uninteresting sequences;
and when the shield-work
(and pierced shield-work
at that) was superadded, it
sometimes became mere confusion.</p>

</div>
</div>


<p>Another distinguishing motive
of shield-work,&mdash;the cartouch&mdash;is
simply what its
name implies, the representation
of the armorial shield with
its supports. The supports
were pierced in every conceivable
manner with circles, lozenges,
crescents and all sorts
of openings.</p>

<p>"The Elizabethan, pure and
simple," writes Mrs. Spofford, "has this
strap-work sometimes finished off with
slight scrolls&mdash;'foliages,' the Italians
called them&mdash;and associated with some
classical ideas not yet very exclusively
or carefully managed; straps appearing
well riveted to the middle of classic ornaments,
and antique shapes rising, from the
curious Renaissance pilaster, which was
neither a vase nor a pilaster, in truth,
broken as it is half way by the rising
shape, like those of the Termae, with
which the ancients made their boundaries
sacred, smaller at the base than anywhere
else, and bearing straps, arabesques
and rosettes on its face."</p>

<p>You will sometimes find an Elizabethan
chimney-piece, the fluted and channelled
columns, and the entablature of which are
almost quite pure in style, and yet, almost
invariably, somewhere about their length
strap-ornament is sure to be introduced.</p>

<p>With the accession of James I. to the
English throne a new influx of foreign
influence made fresh havoc with such
Gothic as remained. The shield, which,
through a preference for the strap had been
but sparsely used in the preceding reign,
came now to be the centre of all decoration,
and was lavished everywhere in a wild
whirl of flourishing curves, together
with the previously common
straps and buckles and general
tackle of war. Its universal
use gave a somewhat less interesting
air to the decoration
than when the purer interlacing
of the strap, with but here
and there the convolutions of
the shield, supplied its place.</p>

<p>But the Jacobean by no
means contented itself with
this simpler form of the Renaissance.
In other characteristics
it tended more and
more to the Classic, though
never arriving at purity. In
construction, the horizontal of
the antique mingled with the
vertical of the mediæval, and
a volute upheld the pointed
arch; in ornament, the Tudor
leaf with a Grecian frieze, with
other equally inappropriate arrangements.
It was not for a
hundred years thereafter that
pure Classic came to be understood
in England. The scallop
shell seems, at this period,
to have caught the fancy of
the designers as a motive,
and they used it at every turn.
These shell forms and the
shell in decoration disputed
with cartouch and straps, with
rosette and scroll, with the fabulous
griffins, and with grotesque
mermaids, whose tails,
turning into scrolls, are seen
dividing to the right and left
in the ornamentation of Jacobean
furniture and chimney-pieces.</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>But the influence of the
Italian form of the Renaissance,
through the filter of the
Flemish, made itself very distinctly
felt in the Jacobean
style; not so much in the
effort of the Italian toward
æsthetic perfection, as in the
play of fancy, stimulated by
the sight of new forms, but
unacquainted with the laws
that should control them.</p>

<p>Upon whatever architectural
or decorative scheme it
was based, however, the carving
of this period was extremely
rich and beautiful;
and in consequence the time
has come to be known as
the "Cinquecento period" in
English art, which corresponds
in many of its characteristics
to the style known in other
countries by the same name.
The illustrations show the
development of these styles
and the main characteristics
which have been pointed out.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
